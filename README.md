# TreeViz

Visualization toolkit for sklearn Decision Trees using graphviz and pydotplus.

# Installation

TreeViz displays and modifies Decison Trees using [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/), an open source graph visualization software. GraphViz must be installed on your machine in [a location that pydotplus searches](https://pydotplus.readthedocs.io/reference.html#pydotplus.graphviz.find_graphviz). The installation at [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/graphviz#:~:text=anaconda%20%2F%20packages%20%2F%20graphviz%201,Open%20Source%20graph%20visualization%20software.) is a good place to start, as it will add the GraphViz location to PATH in most scenarios.

Once GraphViz is installed, TreeViz can be installed through pip:

```
pip install treeviz
```
